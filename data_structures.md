## Queues
Queue is an abstract data structure, which is open at both its ends.Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology.
### Basic Operations:
* enqueue() − add (store) an item to the queue.
* dequeue() − remove (access) an item from the queue.
* peek() − Gets the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
* isfull() − Checks if the queue is full.
* isempty() − Checks if the queue is empty.
### Where to use:
you have to use Queues when things don't have to be processed immediately, but have to be processed in First In First Out order.
### Big-O:
#### Access: Θ(n)	
#### Search: Θ(n)	
#### Insertion: Θ(1)
#### Deletion: Θ(1)
